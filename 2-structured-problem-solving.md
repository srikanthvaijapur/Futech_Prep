#### Tips and Tricks


**1. Run code on your own system**:

Don't run your code directly on HackerRank or Edabit. It will be difficult for you to debug the code and you'll end up wasting a lot of time.

**Instead:**

1. Install your programming language of choice on your system.
2. Install VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Write your own test cases
4. Once the code works on your system, submit it on HackerRank / Edabit

**2. Write Helper functions**

1. Break down your problem into small steps
2. Create "helper functions" and test them individually.
