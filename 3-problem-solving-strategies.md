#### Problem solving strategies - checklist

**Whenever you get stuck, go through each strategy** one after the other, and there's a high chance you will find the solution.

Here's the checklist:

#### Solve a problem manually first

* Initially, don't try to look for any logic.
* Pick a small version of problem and do it assuming you don't have to write a program to do the job for you.
* Now that you have solved the problem manually, try 2-3 more examples.
* Identify pattern / logic
* Translate logic into code

#### Solve specific problem. Find Pattern. Generalize solution.

* Solve a specific problem
* Look for patterns
* Then generalize the solution


#### Solve a simpler related problem

1. First, solve a simpler version of the problem. For example, if the problem is "Given an array of numbres, find all the indexes where this number is present.". First solve "Check whether this number is present" first.
2. Get insights from the simpler problem.
3. Finally solve the original problem.


#### Use common techniques and data structures

Check whether you can use:

- Sorting
- Objects / Hash Maps / Dictionaries
- 2D arrays
- Recursion

#### Break down problem into smaller problems

As we have seen before, break down your problem into smaller steps. Solve each step individually and then combine the steps.


#### Work backwards

* Assume that a subproblem is already solved. Now figure out what you need to do for the current problem.
* These technique is especially useful to check if recursion can be applied.


#### Learn Common coding tips and tricks. Make time to read other people's code

* Don't look up solutions online when you are in the middle of solving a problem.
* But do check out other people's code often to learn common coding skills.
* Read code from GeeksforGeeks like: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-sum-problem/?ref=leftbar-rightbar
* GeeksforGeeks usually have both "brute force" solutions and also efficient solutions which require more knowledge of algorithms. At this stage, if you understand "brute force" solutions, it's good enough!

#### This is too much!

* It's normal to feel a bit overwhelmed. Learn one skill each day and learn at your own pace. If you practice everyday and continue to add new skills to your toolbox, you will get there.
* Just remember to check this list whenever you get stuck. Soon, you'll apply this techniques naturally and subconsciously.
* The code I showed you in the videos seemed to work in first attempt, but it took multiple attempts for me. You don't see all the stuff I've edited out or all the bugs I introduced! So don't get frustrated. Take a break and try different strategies.
